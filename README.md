# Archer Adventure (WIP)

## Game Details

WIP platforming adventure game where the player's only weapon is their bow.

Move with the `WASD` keys. Interact with the menu and the world with the `F` key. Fire your bow with the `Space`bar. Holding the spacebar for varying lengths of time will result in different strength arrows.

## Implementation Details

This project started out as a way to learn more about the ECS architecture for game development. I implemented my own framework for it that is used extensively throughout the project. I also enjoyed working on the dialogue progression system, which has different pieces of dialogue continue to be unlocked as different actions occur in the game.

## Running the project

`yarn dev` - Runs a server at http://localhost:8080. The browser will automatically refresh with any code changes.
`yarn gh-pages` - Builds the project into the `docs/` folder for publishing on GitHub pages.
