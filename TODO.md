- rename systems to `hasInteractionCircle`, `hasSprite`
  - what about the sign system? feels almost too specific. maybe there is an `interactsWith` system to be built that takes a set of tags and a callback?
- organize types for tag/entity system
- convert remaining "components" to tag/entity system

aside:
> this is starting to feel a hell of a lot like react hooks - especially the `hasIndicator` system

- interact with the sign

- animal walking around in fence

- state graph visualization

- enemy

- go into house
