- need a better way to trigger interactions - the `key.isDown` value is still true immediately when loading up the house, and you're standing in front of the door to go back outside

- when coming back through a door, should go to the corresponding door's location in the other map

- should the hasInteractionCircle have concepts for 'entering' and 'leaving'? right now the indicator animation is force-played and it shouldn't be

- systems probably should put their vars on the entities in buckets, rather than keep them all on the same flat level

- interact with the sign

- state graph visualization

- enemy

- controlable controls should be used every where, no raw key codes
